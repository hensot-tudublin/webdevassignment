  <h3> Goals-The CRM Project </h3>
  <p>The CRM Project overview provides detail for how the project will address Midtown
Motors’ problems with its existing CRM system. The overview consists of a project
description, goals and objectives for the CRM Project, project performance criteria, project
assumptions, constraints, and major milestones. As the project is approved and moves
forward, each of these components will be expanded to include a greater level of detail in
      working toward the project plan.</p>
<p>Project Description
Midtown Motors will hire an outside IT vendor to build the new CRM system. This
vendor will review and analyze several potential RDBMS systems to replace the
company’s current CRM. This will be done by determining and selecting a product
which adequately replaces our existing system and still allows for growth for the next 10
years, including expanding staff at existing locations, as well as opening additional
dealership locations. Once selected, the project will replace our existing system in a
phased implementation approach and be completed once the new system is operational
    and the legacy system is archived and no longer in use.</p>
<p>This project will result in increased sales, better customer relations, significantly lower
marketing costs, and reduced employee turnover as a result of providing sales staff with
tools to maximize their commissions and avoid internal conflicts over which customer
“belongs” to which salesperson. Sales managers will similarly benefit from the new
    system.</p><p>
Once the new system is built and installed, most maintenance will be done by internal IT
    resources, with only the largest maintenance and repair projects being outsourced.</p>

  <h3>Provide excellent customer
      service</h3><p>
Understanding the needs of each customer will delight the customer
base, making it more likely they will buy not only their next vehicle
from us, but every vehicle they will ever buy.
Reduce employee turnover
Increased sales mean increased pay for sales staff, and being able to
immediately see which customer “belongs” to which salesperson will
reduce internal conflicts that currently damage morale.
Reduce marketing costs Sharply decrea</p>
